# Glowing Adventure

Glowing Adventure is a small browser game where you control a wisp of light named **Luma**. The goal is to reclaim the darkened world by drawing trails of light.

## How to Play

1. Move your mouse to guide Luma around the map.
2. Hold the mouse button to create a glowing path. Loop back to your territory to fill in new areas.
3. Avoid the red "Flickers" that roam the darkness. If they touch your trail before you finish a loop, you will lose your progress.
4. Watch the "Reclaimed" percentage at the top to track how much territory you've recovered.

## Running the Game

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. An internet connection is required on first load to pull in Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts.

Enjoy the adventure!
